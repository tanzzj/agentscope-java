/**
 * The SDK's built-in HITL clarification capability as a plain middleware (spec §9, v1.10):
 * attach with {@code HarnessAgent.builder().middleware(new ClarificationMiddleware())} to give
 * the agent the {@code ask_user_question} tool, independent of any A2UI toggle.
 *
 * <p>Registers the <em>plain</em> flavour of the tool ({@code enableA2ui=false}): the tool
 * validates the structured questions and suspends with the canonical {@code {"questions":[…]}}
 * JSON, which an AG-UI frontend renders as a native plain-text question card — no catalog,
 * renderer or A2UI runtime involved.
 *
 * <p>When A2UI is enabled, {@link A2uiMiddleware} registers the same tool name with
 * {@code enableA2ui=true} (questions compiled into an A2UI form envelope). {@code
 * Toolkit#registerTool} is a map put, so mount exactly one of the two; if both are mounted, the
 * middleware rebound last wins.
